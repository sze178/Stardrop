APIs used:
1. BoozeAPI: Returns drink information which will change the price of the drink and image displayed using the returned ingredients list.
2. WhereTheISSAtAPI: Returns the city that the bar is above at the time the player time traveled to (essentially replacing the ISS with the bar for simplicity).
